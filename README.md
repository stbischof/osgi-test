# OSGi Testing Support

Testing support for OSGi

## Purpose

This project provides a set of bundles which contain useful and helpful classes for testing of OSGi API.

### [org.osgi.test.common][1]

This artifact includes common utility classes which are useful in all testing scenarios.

### org.osgi.test.assertj.*

These artifacts provides support classes for OSGi testing with [AssertJ](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core) including custom assertions. Currently there are artifacts for [org.osgi.framework][2] and [org.osgi.util.promise][3].

### [org.osgi.test.junit4][4]

This artifact provides support classes for OSGi testing with [JUnit 4](https://junit.org/junit4/) including JUnit 4 Rules.

### [org.osgi.test.junit5][5]

This artifact provides support classes for OSGi testing with [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) including JUnit 5 Extensions.

### [org.osgi.test.junit5.cm][6]

This artifact provides support classes for OSGi testing with ConfigurationAdmin and [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) including JUnit 5 Extensions.

## Building

We use Maven to build and the repo includes `mvnw`.
You can use your system `mvn` but we require a recent version.

## Code Coverage

We use JaCoCo to collect code coverage statistics. Thes are uploaded to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/github/osgi/osgi-test) or you can view the results by running `mvnw verify`
on your local machine.
